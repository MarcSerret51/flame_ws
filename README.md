# Flame_ws

Flame_ws provides a simple web interface for managing existing models and running predictions. 

Flame_ws is in active development and **no stable release has been produced so far**. Even this README is under construction, so please excuse errors and inaccuracies.

## Installing
Flame_ws asumes that Flame (https://github.com/phi-grib/flame) is already installed and reachable in the *PYTHONPATH*. In development environments where Flame is installed in another location, the full path must be defined (hardcoded) at the top of file `flame_ws.py`. 

The server is started by typing:

```sh
python flame-ws.py 
```	

To access the web graphical interface, open a web browser and enter the address *http://localhost:8081*

The web page contains two tabs

### Manage

![Alt text](images/flame-ws-manage.png?raw=true "manage tab")

The page is divided in three regions:
* Models available. A list of existing models and versions, in an expandable tree
* Model details. A detailed description of the model selected in the model tree view
* Tools. A toolbox with commands which can be executed

| Command | Equivalent Flame command | Description |
| --- | --- | ---|
| Clone | *python -c manage -a publish -e NEWMODEL* | Clones the development version, creating a new version in the model repository. Versions are assigned sequential numbers |
| Export | *python -c manage -a export -e NEWMODEL* | Exports the model entry NEWMODE, creating a tar compressed file *NEWMODEL.tgz* which contains all the versions. |
| Delete Model| *python -c manage -a kill -e NEWMODEL* | Removes NEWMODEL from the model repository. **Use with extreme care**, since the removal will be permanent and irreversible  |
| Delete Version | *python -c manage -a remove -e NEWMODEL -v 2* | Removes the version specified from the NEWMODEL model repository |
| New model | *python -c manage -a new -e NEWMODEL* | Creates a new entry in the model repository  |
| Import | *python -c manage -a import -e NEWMODEL* | Imports file *NEWMODEL.tgz*, creating model NEWMODEL in the local model repository |

### Predict

![Alt text](images/flame-ws-predict.png?raw=true "predict tab")

Select a SDFile in the *Input* field, using the browse button. Select the *model* and *version* and press the *Predict* button. After a short while, the results are shown in tabular format.

Results can be exported to a .tsv formatted file pressing the *Export* button.


## API

Web API services available:

(in development)

| URL | HTTP verb | Input data | Return data | HTTP status codes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| /info | GET | | application/json: info_message response | 200 |
| /dir | GET | | application/json: available_services response | 200 |
| /predict | POST | multipart/form-data encoding: model and filename | application/json: predict_call response | 200, 500 for malformed POST message |

The exact synthax of the JSON object returned by predict will be documented in detail elsewhere.
